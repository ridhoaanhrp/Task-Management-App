# Implementation UI Design

Task Management App project.

# Description

It is a very practical application in task management. Great for freelance projects/teams/remote positions. With this application, we can add tasks, manage schedules, view todo lists, view progress and much more.

This application was designed by a UI Designer named Musfiqur Rahman which was uploaded on the Dribbble website. I implemented the design using Flutter.
